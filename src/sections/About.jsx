      <p className="max-w-3xl leading-relaxed">Hi, I'm Briadon. I'm a teenage computer enthusiast from South Africa, still in school. I spend most of my time building tools and websites — it's something I've loved growing up. I’m not very social, but I enjoy being on my own because it helps me focus and be creative. I started coding when I was 12, right after I got my first laptop. It had tons of problems, but that’s what got me into fixing things — both software and hardware. I didn’t know much at first, but every issue taught me something new. That’s how I learned to troubleshoot, experiment, and build. I’m passionate about both front-end and back-end coding, and I’m fascinated by everything to do with computers, from hardware to software. One day, I hope to start a big PC-building company and work in the cyber-security field.</p>
